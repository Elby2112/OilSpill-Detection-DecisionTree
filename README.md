# 🌊 Oil Spill Detection with Decision Tree

## Overview
This project presents a simple implementation of a Decision Tree model 🌳 to classify satellite image patches as either containing an oil spill 🛢️ or not.

## Dataset
- **Source**: The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle. [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudhanshu2198/oil-spill-detection) 📊.
- **Description**: The dataset consists of satellite images processed into feature vectors to distinguish between oil spill and non-spill patches.
